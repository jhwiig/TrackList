# Tracklist
TrackList is a macOS app that acts as a miniplayer for audio players, similar to picture-in-picture. Currently, Spotify is the only streaming service that TrackList works with, although more platforms are planned.

I used Kingfisher to load the album artwork in the overlay. It's very simple to use and effective! Check out the project [here][kingfisher-repo].
